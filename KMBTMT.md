The lights were too bright. The conversation was too polite. Everybody knew that no one wanted to be here, schmoozing up to each other and acting all polite. Especially the other girls. Max sat there in a state of irritability. She was only here because Aiden’s girlfriend was busy, and he had begged her to ‘please come because you’re my sister and I really don’t want my girlfriend to hound me about seeing other girls tonight’. 

Blood runs thicker than water, so eventually she relented. It may also have been because Aiden dropped the fact that a bunch of girls were attending the event too, who were single and very much Max’s type. But that was neither here nor there.

So Max had tried her best to look the part of a hockey girlfriend. She styled her hair,  twirled a mascara wand through her lashes, bought some press-on nails that looked pretty enough and put them on, and picked out her most glamorous dress. It was her graduation dress from high school, a sleek black dress which she happily picked out to double as a casual going-out dress. But when going out with her friends, the appeal of comfortable tank tops and jeans always won, so it had been sitting in her dorm collecting dust the past few months.

“Max, this is Brandon and his girlfriend Ella.” A couple appeared. They were the typical hockey couple, where the guy was a 5 out of 10 on a good day, and the girl was jaw-droppingly stunning. 

Max quickly took a step away from Aiden and waved at the girl, Ella, whose bright smile immediately changed to confusion. “Oh, this is my sister Max, she’s my plus one.” Aiden quickly explained. Brandon nodded and put his hand around Ella’s waist, prompting her to school her shocked expression and nodding as well. 

She quickly recovered, putting on another smile and asking Max, “Do you go to BU?” 

“Yup, first year here.” 

Ella thought for a moment. “Oh, so you’re Aiden’s _younger_ sister?” 

“Sure am!”

“That’s great, how are you finding BU so far?”

Max hesitated. The honest answer would be overwhelming. Cold, rainy Boston was very different from her private high school in sunny California, where everything was taken care of. But that was way too deep for someone she’d just met, especially Ella who seemed to be expecting an answer as cheery as her smile. “Really fun,” Max answered. “It’s great having a brother on the hockey team. I get invited to loads of events.”

Ella laughed. “I bet!”

"What about you? Are you a student here as well?" Max asked politely.

Ella shook her head. "No, I'm just dropping by for Brandon. I'm a model in New York."

Max widened her eyes. Sure, there were a lot of good looking girls at the function, but she had not expected there to be actual models. "Wow, that's so cool."

Ella smiled. "Thank you."

Max was at a loss for words. She knew hockey players, especially D1 hockey players like Aiden, attracted girls like honey. But those girls somehow felt 'other' to her, like they would have acted like she was invisible if they saw her around. They were effortlessly HOT hot, and she was alright hot, if she took the effort to put on makeup and do her hair and actually try.

Thankfully, Aiden came to her rescue. "Let's go," he announced as he unceremoniously grabbed her arm and led her away. "Bye!" Max called to Ella as she punched Aiden none too gently to let her go. He stuck his tongue out at her glare, leading the both of them to another group of guys with a ready supply of arm candy.

It was the same cycle over and over again. Aiden introduced each of his friends and their girlfriends, and Max proceeded to make small talk with the girls while Aiden talked to his. At least she got to know some people from different schools and different disciplines, which could help if she ever wanted to sneak into the other schools' parties. But with her workload, it wasn't exactly like she had loas of time for the Boston-Cambridge party scene, Max thought with an annoyed huff.

With Aiden rehashing their game-winning goal for the umpteenth time to impress another bunch of girls, Max zoned out and let her gaze wander the hall.
